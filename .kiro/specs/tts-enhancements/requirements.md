# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Piper TTS Server is a multi-model, multi-speaker Text-to-Speech API built with FastAPI. The server currently provides a robust backend for generating speech from text using various voice models. This enhancement project aims to improve the system in three key areas: documentation, user interface, and application stability. Additionally, we will create a proposal for future enhancements to guide ongoing development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer or system administrator, I want comprehensive documentation for the TTS server, so that I can easily understand, deploy, configure, and use the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the documentation THEN the system SHALL provide a clear overview of the TTS server architecture and components.
2. WHEN a user reads the documentation THEN the system SHALL provide detailed API endpoint descriptions and usage examples.
3. WHEN a user wants to deploy the system THEN the documentation SHALL include installation and deployment instructions.
4. WHEN a user wants to configure the system THEN the documentation SHALL provide a complete reference of all configuration options.
5. WHEN a developer wants to extend the system THEN the documentation SHALL include development guidelines and code structure explanation.
6. WHEN a user encounters an error THEN the documentation SHALL include a troubleshooting section with common issues and solutions.

### Requirement 2: User-Friendly Frontend

**User Story:** As an end user, I want a user-friendly web interface for the TTS server, so that I can easily generate speech from text without needing to understand the API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the TTS server THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive web interface that works on desktop and mobile devices.
2. WHEN a user wants to generate speech THEN the system SHALL provide an intuitive text input area with clear character limits.
3. WHEN a user wants to select a voice THEN the system SHALL provide a dropdown with all available models and speakers.
4. WHEN a user generates speech THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator during generation.
5. WHEN speech generation completes THEN the system SHALL provide audio playback controls with a waveform visualization.
6. WHEN a user wants to save generated speech THEN the system SHALL provide download options in appropriate audio formats.
7. WHEN a user generates multiple speech samples THEN the system SHALL maintain a history of recent generations.
8. WHEN a user interacts with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and error messages.

### Requirement 3: Application Stability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a stable and reliable TTS server, so that I can provide consistent service to users with minimal maintenance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server is under heavy load THEN the system SHALL maintain responsiveness and prevent crashes.
2. WHEN multiple requests are made simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrency properly without resource conflicts.
3. WHEN an error occurs in speech generation THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with appropriate error messages.
4. WHEN the server starts up THEN the system SHALL validate configuration and model availability.
5. WHEN a model is missing or corrupted THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and continue operating with available models.
6. WHEN the server runs for extended periods THEN the system SHALL manage memory efficiently without leaks.
7. WHEN the system is deployed THEN the system SHALL include monitoring endpoints for health and performance metrics.

### Requirement 4: Future Enhancement Proposal

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want a clear proposal for future enhancements to the TTS server, so that I can plan and prioritize development efforts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the proposal THEN the document SHALL include a prioritized list of potential features and improvements.
2. WHEN evaluating technical feasibility THEN the proposal SHALL include high-level technical approaches for each enhancement.
3. WHEN planning development efforts THEN the proposal SHALL include effort estimates for each enhancement.
4. WHEN considering user needs THEN the proposal SHALL explain the user benefits of each enhancement.
5. WHEN planning the roadmap THEN the proposal SHALL organize enhancements into logical phases or milestones.
6. WHEN evaluating dependencies THEN the proposal SHALL identify any external dependencies or prerequisites for enhancements.
